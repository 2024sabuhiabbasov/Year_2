# Year_2 Repository for IB Computer Science Course

Welcome to my Year_2 repository for the IB Computer Science course at UWC ISAK Japan! This repository is where I will be keeping track of materials and projects related to my second year of studying computer science.

## Contents

- `.idea/`: This directory contains project-specific settings and configuration files for my projects in PyCharm.

- `Quizzes/`: In this directory, I can find quizzes related to my computer science course. Quizzes are an essential part of assessing my understanding of the course materials and concepts.

- `Tasks/`: The tasks directory is where I will find assignments and other practical tasks assigned throughout the year. I will make sure to keep my completed tasks organized within this directory.
