Main types of internet access:

1. DSL (Digital Subscriber Line): DSL is a common type of broadband connection that uses existing telephone lines to provide internet access. It offers relatively stable speeds and is widely available in urban and suburban areas.
2. Fiber Optic: Fiber optic internet uses optical fibers to transmit data at very high speeds. It provides faster and more reliable connections compared to DSL. Fiber-optic infrastructure has been expanding in Azerbaijan, especially in major cities.
3. Cable Internet: Cable internet is delivered over coaxial cables, the same cables used for cable TV. It offers higher speeds compared to DSL but might be less widely available.
4. Wireless Broadband: Wireless internet access is provided through cellular networks (3G, 4G, or 5G) by using mobile devices or dedicated wireless routers. This type of access is often used in areas where wired connections are not feasible.
5. Satellite Internet: Satellite internet uses satellite technology to provide internet access. It's typically used in remote or rural areas where other forms of broadband are not available.
6. Wi-Fi Hotspots: Wi-Fi hotspots are areas where you can connect to the internet wirelessly using a Wi-Fi-enabled device like a smartphone or laptop. These hotspots are often found in public places like cafes, restaurants, airports, and hotels.
7. Dial-Up: While becoming less common, dial-up internet access might still be available in some areas. It uses a standard telephone line and is much slower than broadband technologies.
